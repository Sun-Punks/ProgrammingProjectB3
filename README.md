Whack-a-mole. The player has a hammer following the cursor, and each left click triggers the hammer to hit the mole. The moles are then forced to go back into their hole. There will be a timer of 1 minute and as it goes down, the rate of the moles popping up gets faster. There is a random choice that there may be a power-up on one of the moles, and if the player successfully hits the mole that has the power-up it will then activate and the player will either have a time-freeze(freezes the timer), fever mode(all moles are up and you hit them as much as you can for a higher score), and more. When the timer hits 0:00, all moles go back down into their hole and stop coming out. It shows a game over screen. It also gives the player their score, and their high score. If they want to play again, they can press play again.

# Programming Project Proposal 2
Racing Game. The player controls a car with either arrow keys or WASD. W is to accelerate forward and S is to accelerate backwards. A and D is for steering. A is for left, D is for right. After the player knows the controls, it will be racing against random bots. These bots are coded to go as fast as possible to make the game hard. The player can reach a maximum of 74-75 mph. After that, they can't accelerate any faster. The racer has to stay on the track, if they hit any obstacle or go off the track, they will stop abruptly, or slow down immensly. After that, the player has cars passing them and the placement they are in will go down. The placement will be shown on the top left corner, and the health bar for the car will show at the bottom The car has a certain amount of health because if it hits an object, it crashes, and if it's health goes down to 0,
