# Programming Individual Project
Whack-a-mole. The player has the number keys 1-9 that will trigger the hammer to go to that hole. Every time a number is hit, the hammer is then moved to that hole and slam down on the mole. The moles are then forced to go back into their hole. There will be a timer of 1 minute and as it goes down, the rate of the moles popping up gets faster. There is a random choice that there may be a power-up on one of the moles, and if the player successfully hits the mole that has the power-up it will then activate and the player will either have a time-freeze(freezes the timer), fever mode(all moles are up and you hit them as much as you can for a higher score), and more. When the timer hits 0:00, all moles go back down into their hole and stop coming out. It shows a game over screen. It also gives the player their score, and their high score. If they want to play again, they can press play again.
